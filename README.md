# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
Clustering analysis of the retail customers of a wholesale distributor

## Summary
In this project, unstructured and unlabled data from a wholesale distributor about their retail customers was reviewed to analyze the patterns and naive categories. Feature transformation and scaling were applied to optimize data input. Dimension reduction was performed by Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Multiple clustering algorithm were compared both empirically and theoretically. Multiple retail customer categories were predicted and checked against labeled data. The code implementation is completed on top of the baseline python code provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). The detailed project background, data set, implementation instruction and supporting files can be found from [Udacity machine learning project repository](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/customer_segments). The implementation code, result, and discussion are provided in [customer_segmentation.html](https://github.com/ljj-ml/Customer-Segmentation-Analysis/blob/master/customer_segmentation.html).

## Result
89% clustering accuracy was achieved by comparing predictions to labeled customer data.

## Software
The implementation code is written in Python 2.7.
